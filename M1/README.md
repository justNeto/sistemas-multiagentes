# M1 activity
This is the M1 activity to show statistics for an active cleaning robot

### Inputs

Room of MxN.

Number of agents

Initial percetange of dirty cells

Execution in time of T seconds

### Simulation

Start empty dirty cells (random locations)

All roomba start at [1,1].

In every step:
	- If cell is dirty then cleans.
	- If cell is clean, agent chooses a random location and moves, if cannot move then stays.

Program executes in established time

### Analyze the following:
	Max time until all cells were cleaned (or max time)
	Percentage of cleaned cells at the end of sim.
	Number of movements made by all agents
	How number of agents impacst cleaning time and number of movements
